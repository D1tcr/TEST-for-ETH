i think if i want to get my target, i have to walk along the following line.\
\
first, study how to use github in simple project.\
\
second, for perparation to eth's code, search many code about my interesting field in github.\
\
finally, realize my professor's target that he tell us.\
\
looks like so easy that simple and crude, but no do in practice, no thinking in mind. so begin at a easy projection.
